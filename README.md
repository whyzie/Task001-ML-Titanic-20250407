🎯Objectives <br>
Build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
<h2><a id="Def">Data Info</a></h2>
<h4 style="text-align:justify; font-family: Calibri"><br> Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”. <br> 
    <br>  The test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger.<br> 
   <br>   Using the patterns find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.  <br> 
  <br>    Check out the “Data” tab to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where the model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.</h4>
